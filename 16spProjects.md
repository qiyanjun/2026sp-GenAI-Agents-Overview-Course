### Each student is expected to finish two different course projects. 

### Details on Each Course Project and required artifacts: 

+ Each team includes up to three students 
+ Each team is required to submit four artifacts: one report, one codebase,  one slide deck presentation and one video code demo is required on their project
+ Each team member needs to submit all first three artifact files to their own assignment submission entries in Canvas; and host the fourth on youtube. 

+ All numbers in the following are percentage of the full grade option of each coour project: 

+ On the project presentation (50%): 
  - A formal presentation to the instructors (in the last week of semester), presenting your slide deck and your iPython notebook. 
  - A mini presentation to the instructor (on April 7th) on your project idea is expected during one class session. Two slide pages are enough (more is better!). The mini presentation is expected to explain  (WHY/ WHAT/ HOW of your project idea!)
  - You slide (Due in Canvas on May 9th) summarizes your project via a powerpoint presentation, describing the results you reproduce 
  - Please formulate your project presentation using [this template]({{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/Project-PresentationTemplate.pptx)
  - A python Jupyter notebook (Due in Canvas on May 9th, together with the slide deck) to present the code, data visualization, and obtain the results and analysis through step by step code cell run. 
  - Your team will go through and show the notebook file at the final project presentation meeting to the instructors. 
  - Please include one page in your slide deck indicating each team member's work split clearly 


+ On the presentation of your project: 
  - To minimize the overhead time cost (switching, wrong setup, ….), we will use zoom for
  - 1. your team slides and let you present
  - 2. your team iPython Notebook and let you cell run
  - Please practice the whole process using your own laptop ( I mean checking the files you will submit into Canvas) for a few times.
  - And please make sure the whole process run as smooth as you can. We will use a timer and will cut you off when reaching 30 mins.


+ On the project report (50%): 
  - Here is the grading rubrics we will use to grade your final report 
  - Clear definition of problem and importance (25%)
  - Clear explanation of approach (25%)
  - clear summary of results (and/or difficulties) (25%)
  - Well-organized, polished as a whole (25%) 


### Looking forward to your talks, demos and reports! 

### Potential projects or project types: for example, 
- Build a novel dataset to evaluate a certain capability of LLMs / VLMs / agents
  + e.g., personality of LLMs 
  + e.g., characters of LLMs 
  + e.g., safety of LLMs
  + e.g., code security 
  + e.g., for a specific domain, like Health commonsense? 
  + e.g., for a specific domain, like robotic spatial awareness?
  + e.g., CS theory exams?
  + e.g., following certain sofeware specifications?  
- Build a GenAI application, like Prompt to Blogpost Creation  
- Build a GenAI application, GenAI-Powered audio editing
- Build a GenAI guardrail, like GenAI generative content detetion 
- Build a GenAI guardrail, like misinforamtion / hallucination detection 
- Reproduce a GenAI paper 
- Many many more!
