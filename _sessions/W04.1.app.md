## Required Readings: AGENT APPLICATIONS
**Core Component:** Translating Agent Architectures into Real-World Systems

Focus on how agent capabilities are adapted to specific domains and product workflows, including user experience, operational constraints, and measurable impact.

**Key Concepts:** Domain adaptation, workflow integration, human-in-the-loop design, reliability in production, evaluation in context, compliance and governance, and case studies (software, education, healthcare, finance, science, and robotics)
