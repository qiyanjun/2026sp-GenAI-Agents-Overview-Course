In this session, our readings cover: 

## Required Readings: MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS 
**Core Component:** Multi-Agent Collaboration - Coordination, Communication, and Collective Intelligence

Understanding how multiple agents work together to solve complex problems.
**Key Concepts:** Agent communication protocols, collaborative problem-solving, role-based coordination, multi-agent architectures

### 2025 HIGH-IMPACT PAPERS on this topic 

+ a. MAR: Multi-Agent Reflexion Improves Reasoning (December 2025)
  - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20845
  - Key Idea: Multi-persona debators prevent degeneration of thought
  - Results: 47% EM on HotPot QA, 82.7% on HumanEval


+ b. Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems (December 2025)
  - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296

  Quantitative Scaling Laws:
  - 180 configurations tested: 5 architectures (single, independent, centralized, decentralized, hybrid) × 3 LLM families × 4 benchmarks
  - Key findings:
    - Capability saturation: Coordination has diminishing returns above ~45% single-agent baseline
    - Error amplification: Independent agents amplify errors 17.2×, centralized reduces to 4.4×
    - Task dependency: Centralized excels on parallelizable tasks (+80.8%), decentralized on web navigation (+9.2%)
    - Sequential tasks: All multi-agent variants degrade performance by 39-70%
  - Predictive framework: 87% accuracy on held-out configurations
  - Validated on GPT-5.2 (MAE=0.071)


+ c. Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms: A Survey of LLMs (January 2025)
  - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06322

  Framework Dimensions:
  - Actors: Agents involved in collaboration
  - Types: Cooperation, competition, coopetition
  - Structures: Peer-to-peer, centralized, distributed
  - Strategies: Role-based, model-based
  - Coordination protocols: Communication patterns
  - Applications: 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, question answering, social/cultural settings
